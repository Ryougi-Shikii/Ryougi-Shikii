Four Queen problem:

The 4 Queens Problem consists in placing four queens on a 4 x 4 chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.
That is, no two queens are allowed to be placed on the same row, the same column or the same diagonal.

Solution :
   MySol: Firstly I noticed the trick to the problem is knight move which is in shape of alphabetical letter "L",
   then after placing queen on the board and another queen on knight move we get two queens, similarly all four queen can be placed.
